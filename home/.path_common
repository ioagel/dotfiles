# What does .git/safe/../../bin mean?
# - .git/safe is a directory inside your repo’s .git folder.
# - ../../bin means: from .git/safe, go up two directories (to the repo root), then into bin.
# So, if your repo root is /home/user/project, then .git/safe/../../bin resolves to /home/user/project/bin.
# What’s the effect?
# - This adds the bin directory from your current git repository to your PATH,
# but only if you are inside a repo where .git/safe exists.
# - This is a safety measure: it only activates custom scripts from bin,
# in repositories you explicitly trust (where you created .git/safe).
# Summary:
# This code safely adds the bin directory of trusted git repositories to your PATH,
# so you can run project-specific scripts, but only in repos you mark as “safe” by creating .git/safe.
