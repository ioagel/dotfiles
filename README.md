# Dotfiles

Forked by [Thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles) and heavily
customized using the dotfiles from [Gabe Berke-Williams](https://github.com/gabebw/dotfiles)
and [Chris Toomey](https://github.com/christoomey/dotfiles).

## Requirements

Set zsh as your login shell:

    chsh -s $(which zsh)

## Ubuntu (24.04)

- Need to compile `i3blocks` from git: <https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks>, because it has older version
  - To support variable passing to custom scripts
